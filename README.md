HTML and CSS work together to create a visually appealing and user-friendly website for this Science Museum. HTML defines the structure and content, while CSS enhances the presentation and styling, resulting in an engaging online experience for visitors.

## Getting Started

Here are the popular development tools used for building this website:

- Text Editor-these are lightweight tools that primarily focus on code editing.

   Visual Studio Code (VSC) as a code editor to build HTML and CSS files.

   This is a popular choice among web developers.

- Browser Development Tools: - Chrome DevTools - Firefox Developer Tools
   Built-in browser developer tools that allow developers to inspect, debug, and profile web pages in real time, aiding in troubleshooting and
   optimization.

### Installing

- Figma is a collaborative design tool that I used for creating user interfaces (UI), to create designs and prototypes.
- GitHub:
  Create a new repository on the GitHub homepage.
  A repository on GitHub, which is a version control platform for managing this project.
  Clone the repository to the local machine using Git, which can be installed from git-scm.com.
  Initialize the repository with an empty HTML and CSS file. Open the terminal, navigate to the project folder, and use the command: git init

### Running

Use Git commands (git add, git commit, git push) to track and commit the changes to the local repository.
Push the committed changes to the GitHub repository using the command: git push -u origin main.
Utilize version control practices, such as creating branches (git branch) for new features or bug fixes and merging them (git merge) back into the main branch.
